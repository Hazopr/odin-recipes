# odin-recipes

The current project I am working on is to create a website that contains different recipes for all types of food. Once I have finished this project, I can demonstrate that capability to use HTML to create a basic website, use Git, and GitHub, aswell as to prove to myself that I am capable of becoming a software engineer no matter how hard it is.
