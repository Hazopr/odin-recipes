        <p>Chef Kyle Bailey makes these cheese-stuffed "Juicy Lucy" burgers with a custom blend of ground rib eye steak and pork fatback, and serves them on homemade herb-butter rolls. This streamlined version for the home cook calls for ground beef chuck and store-bought brioche buns.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>8 Cups shredded cabbage</li>
            <li>4 beef pattys natural feed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups baby arugula</li>
            <li>5 large shallots, very thinly sliced crosswise and separated into rings</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss 1 tablespoon of kosher salt with the cabbage and massage it until it softens and releases its liquid, about 4 minutes. Drain the cabbage in a colander and rinse it.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the bowl. Add the vinegar, sugar, mustard seeds, 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of salt. Add the cabbage to the vinegar mixture, toss to coat and place a plate on top to keep it submerged. Let stand at room temperature for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, heat 1 1/2 inches of vegetable oil to 325Â°. In a medium bowl, toss the shallots with the Wondra flour. Fry the shallots all at once, stirring gently, until golden, about 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the shallots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season the shallots with salt. Reserve the cooking oil.</li>
        </ol>
