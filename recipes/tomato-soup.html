    <p>My husband never loved tomato soup until he tried this Creamy Tomato Soup. The addition of parmesan and just 1/2 cup of cream makes it so satisfying. Itâ€™s also a quick and easy 30-minute soup that keeps well in the fridge.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Garlic, about 1 Tbsp</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes with the juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chicken stock</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Whipping cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Saute Aromatics - heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute.</li> 
       <li>Make the tomato soup base - stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>Blend if desired - use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>
       <li>Add cream and parmesan - stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.</li>
       <li>Serve - ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil.</li>
    </ol>
